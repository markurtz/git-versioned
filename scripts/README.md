# GitVersioned - Utility Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts designed to assist with local development, maintenance, and automation tasks for GitVersioned.

> [!NOTE]
> These scripts are intended for developer and CI/CD use only and are **not** distributed as part of the final application package.

## Usage Guidelines

To ensure a consistent development experience across the organization, please adhere to the following guidelines when running or adding scripts.

### Execution

Scripts should generally be executed from the root of the repository to ensure relative paths resolve correctly:

```bash
# Example
./scripts/<script_name>.sh
```

Ensure the script has execution permissions before running:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/<script_name>.sh
```

### Scripting Standards

If you are adding or modifying a script in this directory, please ensure it adheres to the following best practices:

- **Prefer Bash (`.sh`) or Python (`.py`):** These languages provide the best cross-platform compatibility.
- **Fail Fast (Bash):** Always begin Bash scripts with `set -euo pipefail` to ensure they exit immediately on errors, undefined variables, or pipeline failures.
- **Environment Variables:** If your script requires secrets or environment-specific configurations, document them at the top of the script and ensure they align with the `.env.example` file.
- **Provide Help:** Scripts should ideally accept a `-h` or `--help` flag that outputs usage instructions.
- **Log Clearly:** Prefix output with `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, or `[ERROR]` to make CI/CD logs easier to read.

## Available Scripts

*Currently, there are no utility scripts in this directory.*
