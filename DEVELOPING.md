# Developing `gitversioned`

This guide provides instructions for setting up your development environment, navigating the project structure, and adhering to our coding standards.

## Setup & Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the requirements below to establish a consistent local development environment, or utilize our containerized development setup.

### Supported Operating Systems

- **macOS & Linux**: Standard operating systems that are fully supported, actively tested, and maintained.
- **Windows**: Not officially tested or maintained. Windows users encountering issues should use the [Development Environment Container](#development-environment-container-devcontainer) setup.

### Development Environment Container (.devcontainer)

- **Requirements**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the **[Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)** extension installed.
- **Usage**:
  1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/markurtz/git-versioned.git`
  1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
  1. A prompt will appear: "Reopen in Container". Click it to launch the environment.
  1. VS Code will build the container and automatically run `uv sync --all-groups --all-extras` to install and sync the Python environment.

> [!NOTE]
> **Local `.venv` vs. Hatch Environments**:
> The `uv sync` command creates a local `.venv` in the project root solely to provide VS Code extensions (like [Pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release) and [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff)) with a standard environment for editor autocomplete, hover information, and in-editor diagnostics. All command-line and automated task execution (formatting, linting, testing, building) is managed via **[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/)** isolated environments (`hatch run ...`). Do not activate or modify this root `.venv` directly for running tasks.

### Local Setup

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Version control tool. Refer to the [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) for installation instructions.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: Container management system. Install via the [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.10 - 3.14**: Core runtime environment. Install via the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**: Fast package installer and resolver. Install via the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
- **[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/)**: Project workflow orchestrator. Install via the [Hatch installation guide](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/). If you have `uv` installed, we recommend installing Hatch cleanly as a tool using:
  ```bash
  uv tool install hatch
  ```
  to avoid polluting your global system packages.

> [!TIP]
> **Editor Autocomplete Setup (Local)**:
> For local development outside of the Dev Container, if you want your editor (VS Code, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), etc.) to resolve imports and provide autocomplete/diagnostics, run `uv sync --all-groups --all-extras` once to create the local `.venv`.

## Developer Quickstart

Once your environment is set up (either via the Dev Container or manually), follow this consolidated workflow for a standard development cycle:

- **Branch & Code**: Create your feature branch and make changes:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/my-contribution
  ```
- **Quality Assurance (Unified)**: Automatically format code, lint, type check, and run security scans across all environments:
  ```bash
  hatch run all:quality
  ```
  *(Alternatively, you can run individual checks if preferred: `hatch run all:format`, `hatch run all:lint`, `hatch run all:types`, or `hatch run all:security`)*
- **Test (Unified)**: Run all unit, integration, and E2E tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  hatch run all:tests-cov
  ```
  *(For running tests without coverage: `hatch run all:tests`)*
- **Build (Unified)**: Compile package artifacts (source & wheels) and build the OCI container image *(requires Docker daemon to be running for the OCI phase)*:
  ```bash
  hatch run all:build
  ```
  *(To build only the Python wheel locally: `hatch build`)*
- **Serve Documentation**: Serve documentation locally (this automatically builds the site):
  ```bash
  hatch run all:docs-serve
  ```
- **Push**: Push your changes to open a Pull Request:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin feat/my-contribution
  ```

## Hatch Development Environments Overview

Our build, verification, and execution pipelines are partitioned into target-specific environments using Hatch. This ensures isolation, prevents dependency bloat, and standardizes workflows:

- **`default`**: The base environment template. It configures shared environment variables (such as target paths, directory structures, and script file paths) and installs the core dependency groups.
- **`all`**: The orchestrator environment. It defines cascading workflows to run formatting, linting, typing, security scanning, testing, and documentation generation across all components sequentially or concurrently.
- **`python`**: Encompasses Python-specific verification tools including [Ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) for linting/formatting, [Ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type-checking, [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing, and [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for CLI documentation generation.
- **`oci`**: Manages OCI container builds (`docker build`), compose verification (`docker compose config`), linting ([hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)), security auditing ([trivy](https://trivy.dev/), [dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle)), and container structure tests ([cstest](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test)).
- **`project`**: Targets repository-wide configuration and file standards, including Markdown formatting (`[mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat)`), configuration checkouts (`[yamlfix](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix)`, `[yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint)`, `[taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/)`), security baselines (`[detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)`, `[checkov](https://www.checkov.io/)`), link checkers, and site compilation (using the **[Zensical](https://zensical.org)** static site generator/documentation compiler).

## Coding Workflows

All development commands are unified under [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) and managed using Hatch. The commands are generally invoked using the format:

```bash
hatch run [ENVIRONMENT]:[SCRIPT]
```

For orchestrating tasks across all environments, use the `all` environment scripts:

```bash
hatch run all:[SCRIPT]
```

### Quality Assurance & Static Analysis

This workflow enforces code quality, style conventions, static type correctness, and security policies across all codebase layers.

> [!TIP]
> **Unified Quality Check**:
> You can run all formatting, linting, type-checking, and security scans across all environments in a single command using the unified quality check:
>
> ```bash
> hatch run all:quality
> ```

| Environment            | Formatting Command         | Linting Command          | Type-Checking Command        | Security Auditing Command    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **All / Orchestrator** | `hatch run all:format`     | `hatch run all:lint`     | `hatch run all:types`        | `hatch run all:security`     |
| **Python**             | `hatch run python:format`  | `hatch run python:lint`  | `hatch run python:types`     | `hatch run python:security`  |
| **OCI**                | `hatch run oci:format`     | `hatch run oci:lint`     | `hatch run oci:types` \*     | `hatch run oci:security`     |
| **Project**            | `hatch run project:format` | `hatch run project:lint` | `hatch run project:types` \* | `hatch run project:security` |

*\* Note: Type checking is not applicable for OCI and Project environments; executing these commands will output an information message.*

#### Code Formatting

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Uses `[ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff)` to automatically check/fix imports and format code layout. This delivers high-performance style standardization.
  - **OCI**: Uses `[dclint](https://github.com/zavoloklom/docker-compose-linter)` (via a helper script) to auto-format Docker Compose files. While `dclint` is primarily a compose linter, the format step (`hatch run oci:format`) executes it with the `--fix` flag to automatically correct lint errors and standard style issues in place. (Dockerfile linting/validation is handled separately by `[hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)`).
  - **Project**: Employs `[mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat)` for Markdown, `[yamlfix](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix)` for YAML files, and `[taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/)` for TOML file formatting to maintain a uniform structure for all configuration and documentation files.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - In-place modifications applied directly to the files targeted by the respective environment variables: `PYTHON_TARGETS`, `MDFORMAT_TARGETS` (Markdown targets), `YAML_TARGETS`, and `TOML_TARGETS`.

#### Linting & Verification

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Runs `[ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) check` and `[ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) format --check` to verify compliance with PEP 8 and project style guidelines without modifying files.
  - **OCI**: Uses `[hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)` to validate Dockerfile syntax and standard practices, and runs `docker compose config` to verify the syntactic and semantic validity of compose files.
  - **Project**: Runs `[mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat) --check` to check Markdown formatting, `[yamlfix](https://github.com/lyz-code/yamlfix) --check` and `[yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint)` for YAML files, and `[taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/) check` for TOML configuration syntax.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - Summary reports, warnings, and errors output directly to the terminal stdout/stderr. Standard exit codes (non-zero on failures) are used to gate CI pipelines.

#### Static Type Checking

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Employs Astral's `[ty check](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty)` frontend to statically analyze and verify Python type annotations.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - Type checker error listings and tracebacks are printed to the terminal console.

#### Security & Vulnerability Auditing

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Employs `[semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)` for semantic pattern matching, `[pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit)` to detect known vulnerabilities in Python packages, and `[ruff](https://astral.sh/ruff) check --select S` to check for security vulnerabilities.
  - **OCI**: Scans built containers using `[dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle)` (verifies image best practices/secrets) and `[trivy](https://trivy.dev/)` (scans OS-level packages for CVEs).
  - **Project**: Employs `[detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)` to scan for accidentally committed secrets against a baseline, and `[checkov](https://www.checkov.io/)` to scan infrastructure-as-code files and development configurations.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - Standard reports output to the console.
  - Project environment updates and validates the secrets baseline file located at `.detect-secrets.scan.json`. Run `hatch run project:security-update` to update this baseline file.

### Testing Strategy & Suites

Our testing strategy is split into component-level, integration-level, and system-level suites, each of which supports code coverage reporting.

#### Coverage Configurations & Directories

Code coverage runs collect data during test executions and format them into human-readable Markdown summaries.

- **Python Coverage**: Configured to output to `coverage/python/` (`PYTHON_COV_DIR`). The test suites automatically output terminal reports and compile Markdown reports (e.g., `coverage_tests-unit.md`).

| Test Suite                 | Python Command                    | OCI Command                   | Project Command                     | All Command                    |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **All Local Tests**        | N/A                               | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests`          |
| **All Tests + Coverage**   | N/A                               | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests-cov`      |
| **Functional Tests**       | `hatch run python:tests-func`     | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests-func`     |
| **Func Tests + Coverage**  | `hatch run python:tests-func-cov` | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests-func-cov` |
| **Unit Tests**             | `hatch run python:tests-unit`     | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests-unit`     |
| **Unit Tests + Coverage**  | `hatch run python:tests-unit-cov` | N/A                           | N/A                                 | `hatch run all:tests-unit-cov` |
| **Integration Tests**      | `hatch run python:tests-int`      | N/A                           | `hatch run project:tests-int`       | `hatch run all:tests-int`      |
| **Int Tests + Coverage**   | `hatch run python:tests-int-cov`  | N/A                           | `hatch run project:tests-int-cov`   | `hatch run all:tests-int-cov`  |
| **End-to-End Tests**       | `hatch run python:tests-e2e`      | `hatch run oci:tests-e2e`     | `hatch run project:tests-e2e`       | `hatch run all:tests-e2e`      |
| **E2E Tests + Coverage**   | `hatch run python:tests-e2e-cov`  | `hatch run oci:tests-e2e-cov` | `hatch run project:tests-e2e-cov`   | `hatch run all:tests-e2e-cov`  |
| **Link Checks**            | N/A                               | N/A                           | `hatch run project:link-checks`     | N/A                            |
| **Link Checks + Coverage** | N/A                               | N/A                           | `hatch run project:link-checks-cov` | N/A                            |

*\* Note: While Hatch commands for `N/A` cells can technically be run (and will print a message stating that the test suite is not defined for that environment), they have no logical test targets or execution paths. They are marked `N/A` for clarity.*

#### Test Suites Breakdown

#### Full Suite (`tests` / `tests-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**: Executes all local functional and E2E tests across all environments to ensure complete validation of the codebase before code integration.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: Unified console log output, combined test summaries, and all coverage Markdown files compiled under `coverage/python/`.

#### Functional Testing (`tests-func` / `tests-func-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**: Executes both unit and integration tests under the targeted environment to verify logical flows and subsystem communication.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - **Python**: Outputs to console and `coverage/python/coverage_tests-func.md`.

#### Unit Testing (`tests-unit` / `tests-unit-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Runs isolated tests under `tests/python/unit` via `pytest`. Focuses on validating individual modules and class behaviors.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - **Python**: Outputs `coverage/python/coverage_tests-unit.md`.

#### Integration Testing (`tests-int` / `tests-int-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Runs tests under `tests/python/integration` via `pytest` to verify interactions between Python modules.
  - **Project**: Runs documentation code block tests. It utilizes `scripts/generate_doc_tests.py` to parse Markdown files and compile code block assertions under `.tests/docs` (`DOC_TESTS_PATH`), which are then executed using `pytest`.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - **Python**: Outputs `coverage/python/coverage_tests-int.md`.
  - **Project**: Verifies doc tests compile and pass; outputs progress to stdout.

#### End-to-End Testing (`tests-e2e` / `tests-e2e-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**:
  - **Python**: Compiles Python packages with `hatch build`, force reinstalls them via `pip`, and runs pytest against `tests/e2e` (`E2E_TESTS`) to verify CLI commands and package distribution paths in a black-box environment.
  - **OCI**: Builds the OCI image and executes Google's Container Structure Tests (`cstest` via `scripts/run_oci.py`) to confirm that the image metadata, file layouts, and execution endpoints conform to specifications.
  - **Project**: Runs automated tests across the `examples/` directory using pytest to verify real-world integrations.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - **Python**: Outputs `coverage/python/coverage_tests-e2e.md`.
  - **OCI**: Outputs Container Structure Test results to the console.
  - **Project**: Outputs example test execution summaries to the console.

#### Link Checking (`link-checks` / `link-checks-cov`)

- **Methodology & Rationale**:
  - **Project**: Executes `scripts/check_links.py` to recursively crawl project documents (`MDFORMAT_TARGETS`) and verify all internal/external links resolve successfully.
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**:
  - **Project**: Outputs link-checking validation summaries to the console.

#### Test Categorization & Test Pathways

To manage test execution speed and pipeline efficiency, every Python test is categorized into one of our three test pathways: **smoke**, **sanity**, or **regression**. These pathways directly govern how frequently and in which environments those tests are executed in CI/CD pipelines.

##### Pathway Specification & Filtering

A test's pathway can be specified and detected in one of two ways:

1. **By Marker**: Decorating the test function or class with a custom pytest marker (e.g., `@pytest.mark.smoke`, `@pytest.mark.sanity`, `@pytest.mark.regression`).
1. **By Name**: Including the pathway name in the test function or class name (e.g., `def test_smoke_initialization()`, `class TestSanityCore`, `def test_regression_bug_fix()`).

##### Test Pathways Breakdown

- **`smoke`**:
  - **Encapsulation & Scope**: Extremely fast, non-flaky, critical-path verification checks. These confirm that the fundamental, basic logic of the application functions correctly (e.g., orchestrator bootstrap, CLI command recognition).
  - **Execution Frequency**: Run on **every commit and Pull Request** (e.g., `development.yml`) as a quick health gate.
- **`sanity`**:
  - **Encapsulation & Scope**: Detailed, comprehensive tests of core system behaviors, APIs, and edge cases. These verify that the main business logic functions robustly but may take slightly longer than smoke tests.
  - **Execution Frequency**: Run on **pushes to the main branch** (e.g., `main.yml`) and release branches to ensure overall stability of the codebase.
- **`regression`**:
  - **Encapsulation & Scope**: Deep, system-wide, and heavy integration/E2E regression verification checks. These ensure that complex interactions, edge cases, and past bugs do not reappear.
  - **Execution Frequency**: Run on **nightly, weekly, and release schedule pipelines** due to their longer execution time.

##### Default Pathway Execution

If no specific filtering arguments, markers, or keyword flags are provided, pytest assumes a **regression** pathway by default.

Running the test suite without any arguments executes a full regression run. This is because a default regression run executes:

- All smoke tests
- All sanity tests
- All regression tests
- Any tests not marked or named under a specific category

##### Filtering Python Tests

Hatch dynamically passes CLI arguments through to the underlying `pytest` execution via the `{args}` placeholder configured in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml). To filter by test pathways (`smoke`, `sanity`, or `regression`), use pytest's keyword option (`-k`). This correctly matches both annotated markers and naming patterns (e.g., pathway keywords in the function or class name).

- **Run only smoke tests**:
  ```bash
  hatch run python:tests-unit -k smoke
  ```
- **Run sanity and smoke tests**:
  ```bash
  hatch run python:tests-unit -k "sanity or smoke"
  ```

##### Testing a Specific Sub-Package or File

Hatch environments make it easy to target a specific test directory, sub-package, or single file by appending the path to your `hatch run` command. The provided path will override the default directories configured in `pyproject.toml`.

- **Run all tests in a specific file**:
  ```bash
  hatch run python:tests-unit tests/python/unit/test_settings.py
  ```
- **Run tests in a specific sub-package / directory**:
  ```bash
  hatch run python:tests-unit tests/python/unit/compat/
  ```
- **Run functional tests for a specific integration file**:
  ```bash
  hatch run python:tests-func tests/python/integration/test_utils.py
  ```

### Documentation Workflows

Our documentation is managed as code. It includes auto-generated CLI references and a unified project site built using **[Zensical](https://zensical.org)**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Zensical Documentation Tool**:
> [Zensical](https://zensical.org) is a static site generator and documentation compiler configured via `zensical.toml` that integrates [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and its plugin ecosystem (such as [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings) and [macros](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/)) under a simplified configuration structure.

#### CLI Documentation Generation

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**: Uses the `[typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)` utility to compile and output reference docs directly from the Python entrypoint `src/gitversioned/__main__.py`.
- **Command**: `hatch run python:docs`
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: A generated Markdown reference file at `.docs/cli.md`.

#### Project Website Compilation

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**: Compiles the final developer documentation site via **Zensical**, incorporating the general Markdown guides and Python CLI docs.
- **Command**: `hatch run project:docs` (or `hatch run all:docs` to generate Python docs and compile project docs together)
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: Static build files compiled to the `site/` directory.

> [!TIP]
> **Dynamic Coverage Report Inclusion**:
> When compiling the website locally, Zensical dynamically embeds the Python test coverage reports (extracted from `coverage/python/`) into the final reference page (`docs/reference/python_coverage.md`). If the coverage reports have been generated locally, they will automatically be included in the compiled docs site.

#### Live Development Preview Server

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**: Launches a hot-reloading web server to preview changes locally in real-time.
- **Command**:
  - Local Project Server: `hatch run project:docs-serve`
  - Global Orchestrator: `hatch run all:docs-serve`
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: Hot-reloading site hosted locally at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Build & Distribution Workflows

These workflows handle compiling code and building containerized runtimes for distribution.

#### Python Package Build

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**: Uses [Hatchling](https://pypi.org/project/hatchling/) (configured under `[build-system]` in `pyproject.toml`) to bundle Python distribution wheel and source packages.
- **Command**: `hatch build`
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: Built source distributions and `.whl` files output to the `dist/` directory.

#### OCI Container Image Build

- **Tools / Methodology / Rationale**: Executes a Docker build to compile the multi-stage production image, tagging the result using metadata parameters.
- **Command**: `hatch run oci:build`
- **Expected Outputs & Locations**: Local Docker image compiled and tagged as `gitversioned:latest` (configured via `{env:OCI_IMAGE}`).

## CI/CD Workflows

We maintain high quality gates using git workflows, automated reviews, and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipelines.

### Version Control Standards

- **Tools**: Git
- **Workflow & Commands**:
  - **Branching Model**: Standard branch prefixes are enforced:
    - Features: `feat/short-description` or `feature/short-description`
    - Bugs: `fix/short-description` or `bugfix/short-description`
    - Docs: `docs/short-description`
  - **Commit Messages**: Enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`).
  - **Versioning Tags**: Release tags must follow semver format (`v*.*.*`).

### Repository Policy & Pull Requests

- **Tools**: GitHub Pull Requests and Review tools
- **Workflow & Commands**:
  - Open a PR against the `main` branch.
  - All pipeline checks must pass (Linting, static typing, security gates, unit/integration/e2e tests).
  - Require review and approval from at least one core maintainer before merging.

### GitHub Actions Architecture

Our pipelines use a highly modular and DRY architecture to avoid duplication of setup steps:

- **Tools**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

- **Configuration / Manifest Files**: Reusable actions under `.github/actions/...` and triggers under `.github/workflows/...`

- **Python Versioning & Parameters**:

  - All composite actions (Python, OCI, and Project) support an optional `python-version` parameter.
  - If omitted, actions standardize on the oldest supported version (default: `"3.10"`).
  - All composite actions using change detection (`[dorny/paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter)`) support a `force-run` parameter (default: `"false"`). When set to `"true"`, it bypasses path-filtering check gates and executes the steps unconditionally (used in scheduled and release workflows).

- **OCI Tools Native Execution**:

  - The repository utilizes unified platform-agnostic OCI runner logic (`scripts/run_oci.py`).
  - When running in CI under `.github/actions/oci/`, the actions natively install OCI scanning and linting tools (`[hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)`, `[dclint](https://github.com/zavoloklom/docker-compose-linter)`, `[dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle)`, `[trivy](https://trivy.dev/)`, and `[container-structure-test](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test)`) on the runner.
  - This native pre-installation ensures that `run_oci.py` executes these binaries directly on the host machine, bypassing the performance overhead and Docker socket mounting requirements of containerized container-in-container execution.

  > [!WARNING]
  > **Tool Version Drift Risk**:
  > Running these tools natively in CI while developers run them locally via Docker fallback containers (e.g., `aquasec/trivy:latest`) can lead to version drift. To prevent the *"it passes locally but fails in CI"* issue:
  >
  > 1. Keep your system-installed binaries updated to match the versions used in CI workflows (defined in the OCI composite actions).
  > 1. Periodically pull the latest container images locally (`docker pull aquasec/trivy:latest`) to keep Docker fallbacks in sync with CI runner environments.

- **Utility Actions (`.github/actions/utility/...`)**:

  - `setup-python`: Sets up Python, and installs uv and Hatch.

- **Environment Actions (`.github/actions/[env]/...`)**:

  - Partitioned into folders for each environment: `python`, `oci`, and `project`.
  - Inside each environment, standard actions run specific scripts:
    - `quality`: Runs formatting, linting, and type checking.
    - `security`: Runs dependency audits, secrets checks, and security linters.
    - `tests`: Runs unit, integration, and E2E tests, accepting `test-level`, `test-category`, and `generate-coverage` inputs.
    - `build`: Compiles wheels (Python), container images (OCI), or all elements (Project).
    - `publish`: Publishes release packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (Python) or container images to [GHCR](https://github.com/features/packages) (OCI).

- **Workflows (`.github/workflows/...`)**: Triggered pipelines separated into:

  - **Core Pipelines**:
    - `pipeline-development.yml`: PR checks (quality, security, package build, tests, and documentation previews).
    - `pipeline-main.yml`: Triggered on push to `main` branch (runs full checks and deploys latest docs).
    - `pipeline-nightly.yml`: Nightly regression tests, vulnerability audits, and nightly releases.
    - `pipeline-release.yml`: Release tag pushes (`v*.*.*`) or manual UI dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`) on `main` or `releases/*` branches; runs validation checks, tags/pushes the commit (if manually triggered), packages binary builds, attests them, publishes to PyPI and GHCR, and creates releases.
    - `pipeline-weekly.yml`: Scheduled weekly checks to verify environment health.
  - **Utility Workflows**:
    - `util-cleanup.yml`: Cleans up transient PR doc deployments.
    - `util-pr-comment.yml`: Securely posts PR comments (build status, compiled coverage summary, documentation previews, and build packages) to avoid fork permission limits.

### Local Workflow Testing with `act`

You can test and validate [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows locally on your development machine using [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act). This ensures that workflows run correctly before you push changes to GitHub.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** (required by `act` to spin up runner containers).
1. Install `act` using your package manager:
   - macOS ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)): `brew install act`
   - Linux (curl): `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Apple Silicon (M-series Chips) Emulation**:
> If you are on an Apple Silicon Mac, you must specify the target execution architecture using `--container-architecture linux/amd64`. This ensures that `act` pulls the `amd64` container image and installs pre-compiled `x86_64` wheels (such as `taplo`), bypassing compile-from-source errors due to missing arm64 wheels.

#### Running Workflows Locally

Run `act` from the repository root:

- **List all jobs**:

  ```bash
  act -l
  ```

- **Run the default (pull_request) event (runs Development Pipeline)**:

  ```bash
  act pull_request
  ```

- **Run a specific job (e.g., project-quality)**:

  ```bash
  act -j project-quality
  ```

- **Dry-run a workflow (displays steps without execution)**:

  ```bash
  act -n
  ```

#### Mocking Event Payloads (Change Detection)

Because composite actions use `dorny/paths-filter` to detect path-level changes, running `act` directly will fail if the required event metadata is missing. You can provide a mock payload (`event.json`) to simulate the GitHub event context:

1. Create an `event.json` in the root of the repository:
   ```json
   {
     "repository": {
       "default_branch": "main"
     }
   }
   ```
1. Pass the payload file using the `-e` flag:
   ```bash
   act push -W .github/workflows/pipeline-main.yml -j project-quality -e event.json --container-architecture linux/amd64
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> `act` runs steps inside Docker containers that simulate GitHub environments. By default, it uses a medium-sized Ubuntu image, but you can specify a fuller image using `act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`.

### Security & Code Scanning Gates

- **Tools**: [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) (secret scanning), [checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) (infrastructure auditing), [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) (semantic scanning), [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) (Python package audits), and [trivy](https://trivy.dev/) / [dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) (OCI image scanning).
- **Workflow & Rationale**:
  - **Secret Gating**: [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) runs locally and in PR gates against the committed `.detect-secrets.scan.json` baseline to prevent credential leaks.
  - **Static Analysis & CVE Auditing**: [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/), [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/), and [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) run automatically as background checks on every pull request to guarantee compliance with our security baseline.
